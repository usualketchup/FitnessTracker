## Description

*  A fitness tracker that allows the user to create a new workout between a resistance (weights) or cardio exercise type through a 
   small form. For both exercise types, the user must fulfill each field before being able to mark that exercise as complete or adding
   that exercise to the database. The input fields that are required for the resistance exercise type are the exercise name, 
   weight (lbs), sets, reps, and duration (minutes). Whereas for the cardio exercise type, the required input fields are the name, 
   distance (miles), and duration (minutes). If the user selects the 'Complete' option, the browser will notify the user and redirects
   to the home page where the 'Last Workout' is updated to the most recent workout the user completed/added. Otherwise, if the user
   selects the 'Add Exercise' option, the browser will also notify, but the user must click on the Dashboard in the navbar, which will 
   take the user to a statistics page that contains charts/graphs based on inputs that the user typed in. From here, the user can also
   click the 'Fitness Tracker' in the navbar, which gives the Home page with the 'Last Workout' info given.  

## Technologies

    * Visual Studio Code
    * Node.js
    * Express (Server)
    * MongoDB (NoSQL Database) with Robo3T GUI
    * npm - Mongoose
    * npm (Dev) - ESLint 
    * GitHub
    * Heroku with mLab MongoDB add-on

## Challenges

* This fitness tracker took a lot of time to figure out and I eventually learned how to utilize MongoDB properly thanks to going over some class activities and working through each problem that popped up.

* I also learned how to connect a Mongo database by using the Heroku extension mLab mongolab. At first, that was quite confusing but once I read more documentation and went over the class lecture videos again I learned how to work it out quite well!
